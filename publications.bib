abstract = {Large-scale genomic analyses of human cancers have cataloged somatic point mutations thought to initiate tumor development and sustain cancer growth. However, determining the functional significance of specific alterations remains a major bottleneck in our understanding of the genetic determinants of cancer. Here, we present a platform that integrates multiplexed AAV/Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair (HDR) with DNA barcoding and high-throughput sequencing to simultaneously investigate multiple genomic alterations in de novo cancers in mice. Using this approach, we introduce a barcoded library of non-synonymous mutations into hotspot codons 12 and 13 of Kras in adult somatic cells to initiate tumors in the lung, pancreas, and muscle. High-throughput sequencing of barcoded Kras HDR alleles from bulk lung and pancreas reveals surprising diversity in Kras variant oncogenicity. Rapid, cost-effective, and quantitative approaches to simultaneously investigate the function of precise genomic alterations in vivo will help uncover novel biological and clinically actionable insights into carcinogenesis.},

abstract = {DNA instability is an important contributor to cancer development. Previously, defects in the chromosome segregation and excessive DNA double strand breaks due to the replication or oxidative stresses were implicated in DNA instability in cancer. Here, we demonstrate that DNA instability can directly result from the oncogene-induced senescence signaling. Expression of the activated form of Her2 oncogene, NeuT, in immortalized breast epithelial cells led to downregulation of the major DNA repair factor histone H2AX and a number of other components of the HR and NHEJ double strand DNA breaks repair pathways. H2AX expression was regulated at the transcriptional level via a senescence pathway involving p21-mediated regulation of CDK and Rb1. The p21-dependent downregulation of H2AX was seen both in cell culture and the MMTV-neu mouse model of Her2-positive breast cancer. Importantly, downregulation of H2AX upon Her2/NeuT expression impaired repair of double strand DNA breaks. This impairment resulted in both increased DNA instability in the form of somatic copy number alterations, and in increased sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. Overall, these findings indicate that the Her2/NeuT oncogene signaling directly potentiates DNA instability and increases sensitivity to DNA damaging treatments.},

abstract = {Introduction Cancer genomes exhibit surprisingly weak signatures of negative selection[1][1],[2][2]. This may be because tumors evolve either under very weak selective pressures (‘weak selection') or under conditions that prevent the elimination of many deleterious passenger mutations (‘poor efficacy of selection')xs.

Rationale The weak selection model argues that the majority of genes are only important for multicellular function. The poor efficacy of selection model argues, in contrast, that genome-wide linkage in cancer prevents many deleterious mutations from being removed via Hill-Robertson interference[3][3]. Since these linkage effects weaken as mutation rates decrease, we predict that cancers with lower mutational burdens should exhibit stronger signals of negative selection. Furthermore, because linkage affects driver mutations as well, low mutational burden cancers should also show stronger evidence of positive selection in driver genes. Neither pattern — in drivers or passengers — is expected under the weak selection model. We leverage the 10,000-fold variation in mutational burden across cancer subtypes to stratify tumors by their genome-wide mutational burden and used a normalized ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) to quantify the extent that selection varies with mutation rate.

Results We find that appreciable negative selection (dN/dS {\~{}} 0.4) is present in tumors with a low mutational burden, while the remaining cancers (96{\%}) exhibit dN/dS ratios approaching 1, suggesting that the majority of tumors do not remove deleterious passengers. A parallel pattern is seen in drivers, where positive selection attenuates as the mutational burden of cancers increases. Both trends persist across tumor-types, are not exclusive to essential or housekeeping genes, and are present in clonal and subclonal mutations. Two additional orthogonal lines of evidence support the weak efficacy model: passengers are less damaging in low mutational burden cancers, and patterns of attenuated selection also emerge in Copy Number Alterations. Finally, we find that an evolutionary model incorporating Hill-Robertson interference can reproduce both patterns of attenuated selection in drivers and passengers if the average fitness cost of passengers is 1.0{\%} and the average fitness benefit of drivers is 19{\%}.

Conclusion Collectively, our findings suggest that the lack of signals of negative selection in most tumors is not due to relaxed selective pressures, but rather the inability of selection to remove individual deleterious mutations in the presence of genome-wide linkage. As a result, despite the weak individual fitness effects of passengers, most cancers harbor a large mutational load (median {\~{}}40{\%} total fitness cost) and succeed due to acquisition of additional strong drivers ({\~{}}5 with an overall benefit of {\~{}}130{\%}). Understanding how this deleterious load is overcome may help identify cancer vulnerabilities that may be targeted by new and existing therapies.

abstract = {Cancer progression is an example of a rapid adaptive process where evolving new traits is essential for survival and requires a high mutation rate. Precancerous cells acquire a few key mutations that drive rapid population growth and carcinogenesis. Cancer genomics demonstrates that these few driver mutations occur alongside thousands of random passenger mutations-a natural consequence of cancer's elevated mutation rate. Some passengers are deleterious to cancer cells, yet have been largely ignored in cancer research. In population genetics, however, the accumulation of mildly deleterious mutations has been shown to cause population meltdown. Here we develop a stochastic population model where beneficial drivers engage in a tug-of-war with frequent mildly deleterious passengers. These passengers present a barrier to cancer progression describable by a critical population size, below which most lesions fail to progress, and a critical mutation rate, above which cancers melt down. We find support for this model in cancer age-incidence and cancer genomics data that also allow us to estimate the fitness advantage of drivers and fitness costs of passengers. We identify two regimes of adaptive evolutionary dynamics and use these regimes to understand successes and failures of different treatment strategies. A tumor's load of deleterious passengers can explain previously paradoxical treatment outcomes and suggest that it could potentially serve as a biomarker of response to mutagenic therapies. The collective deleterious effect of passengers is currently an unexploited therapeutic target. We discuss how their effects might be exacerbated by current and future therapies.},

abstract = {Cancer progression is driven by the accumulation of a small number of genetic alterations. However, these few driver alterations reside in a cancer genome alongside tens of thousands of additional mutations termed passengers. Passengers are widely believed to have no role in cancer, yet many passengers fall within protein-coding genes and other functional elements that can have potentially deleterious effects on cancer cells. Here we investigate the potential of moderately deleterious passengers to accumulate and alter the course of neoplastic progression. Our approach combines evolutionary simulations of cancer progression with an analysis of cancer sequencing data. From simulations, we find that passengers accumulate and largely evade natural selection during progression. Although individually weak, the collective burden of passengers alters the course of progression, leading to several oncological phenomena that are hard to explain with a traditional driver-centric view. We then tested the predictions of our model using cancer genomics data and confirmed that many passengers are likely damaging and have largely evaded negative selection. Finally, we use our model to explore cancer treatments that exploit the load of passengers by either (i) increasing the mutation rate or (ii) exacerbating their deleterious effects. Though both approaches lead to cancer regression, the latter is a more effective therapy. Our results suggest a unique framework for understanding cancer progression as a balance of driver and passenger mutations.},

abstract = {Genomic instability and high mutation rates cause cancer to acquire numerous mutations and chromosomal alterations during its somatic evolution; most are termed passengers because they do not confer cancer phenotypes. Evolutionary simulations and cancer genomic studies suggest that mildly deleterious passengers accumulate and can collectively slow cancer progression. Clinical data also suggest an association between passenger load and response to therapeutics, yet no causal link between the effects of passengers and cancer progression has been established. To assess this, we introduced increasing passenger loads into human cell lines and immunocompromised mouse models. We found that passengers dramatically reduced proliferative fitness (∼3{\%} per Mb), slowed tumor growth, and reduced metastatic progression. We developed new genomic measures of damaging passenger load that can accurately predict the fitness costs of passengers in cell lines and in human breast cancers. We conclude that genomic instability and an elevated load of DNA alterations in cancer is a double-edged sword: it accelerates the accumulation of adaptive drivers, but incurs a harmful passenger load that can outweigh driver benefit. The effects of passenger alterations on cancer fitness were unrelated to enhanced immunity, as our tests were performed either in cell culture or in immunocompromised animals. Our findings refute traditional paradigms of passengers as neutral events, suggesting that passenger load reduces the fitness of cancer cells and slows or prevents progression of both primary and metastatic disease. The antitumor effects of chemotherapies can in part be due to the induction of genomic instability and increased passenger load. Cancer Res; 77(18); 4763-72. {\textcopyright}2017 AACR.},
