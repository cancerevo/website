# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts) This barely gets used, so don't bother. 
bio: 
  Chris obtained a PhD from Harvard University in Biophysics under the guidance of [Leonid Mirny](http://mirnylab.mit.edu/), 
  studying the effects of deleterious passenger mutations in cancer. 
  As a postdoc, Chis helped develop a high-throughput technology to study combinatorial tumor suppressor losses in mice and their effects on clonal dynamics.

<!-- In college, I studied protein folding in the [Dumont Lab](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/labs/dumont.aspx). --> 
I fell in love with scientific research at the age of 16 in the [Morse Lab](https://www.wadsworth.org/senior-staff/randall-morse) studying gene regulation. 
As a graduate student under the guidance of Prof. [Leonid Mirny](http://mirnylab.mit.edu/), 
I began studying cancer evolution. I argued that tumors harbor many deleterious passenger mutations that 
are harmful to cancer cells, yet nevertheless accumulate and can induce tumor dormancy. These mutations may be exploitable by existing therapies, including 
those that target heat shock pathways and the proteasome.

As a postdoc in [Dmitri Petrov](http://petrov.stanford.edu/) and [Monte Winslow's](https://med.stanford.edu/winslowlab.html) groups at Stanford University,
I co-developed TuBa-seq: a Genetically-Engineered Mouse Model (GEMM) that combines **Tu**mor **Ba**rcoding with multiplexed CRISPR/Cas gene editing and next-generation DNA **seq**uencing. 
We tracked cancer progression with unprecedented precision and genomic-comprehensiveness _in vivo_ 
and discovered a rugged fitness landscape of interactions among cancer-causing mutations.
