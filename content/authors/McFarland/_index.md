# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts) This barely gets used, so don't bother. 
bio: 
  Chris obtained a PhD from Harvard University in Biophysics under the guidance of [Leonid Mirny](http://mirnylab.mit.edu/), 
  studying the effects of deleterious passenger mutations in cancer. 
  Working with [Dmitri Petrov](http://petrov.stanford.edu/) and [Monte Winslow](https://med.stanford.edu/winslowlab.html) at Stanford University as a Postdoc,
  Chis helped develop a high-throughput technology to study combinatorial tumor suppressor losses in mice and their effects on clonal dynamics.

My interest in scientific research began at the age of 16 in the [Morse Lab](https://www.wadsworth.org/senior-staff/randall-morse) studying gene regulation.

In college, I studied protein folding in the [Dumont Lab](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/labs/dumont.aspx). As a graduate student under the guidance of 
Prof. [Leonid Mirny](http://mirnylab.mit.edu/), I began studying cancer evolution. I argued that tumors harbor many 'deleterious passenger' mutations that 
are harmful to cancer cells, yet nevertheless accumulate and can induce tumor dormancy. These mutations may be exploitable by existing therapies, including 
those that target heat shock pathways and the proteasome.

Working with [Dmitri Petrov](http://petrov.stanford.edu/) and [Monte Winslow](https://med.stanford.edu/winslowlab.html) at Stanford University as a Postdoc,
I helped develop a high-throughput technology that combined DNA barcoding with multiplexed CRISPR-based genome engineering to study combinatorial tumor suppressor 
losses in mice. This approach discovered a rugged fitness landscape of context dependencies between cancer-causing mutations.

I joined Case in the fall of 2020.
