My first experience in research was in [Dr. Wenjun Zhang's lab](http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/wzgrp/) at UC Berkeley where I studied natural product production of anaerobic bacteria.

This research ultimately helped me realize that I wanted to understand biology in a more quantitative manner. 
The lab's use of theoretical and experimental techniques to investigate cancer evolution appealed to me because I could learn how to use quantitative methods to better understand biological processes.
In the lab, I'm developing computational and mathematical models of cancer tumor growth and evolution to understand the effects of tumor ploidy changes.
