bio: 


    Chris obtained a PhD from Harvard University in Biophysics under the guidance of [Leonid Mirny](http://mirnylab.mit.edu/), 
  studying the effects of deleterious passenger mutations in cancer. 
  Working with [Dmitri Petrov](http://petrov.stanford.edu/) and [Monte Winslow](https://med.stanford.edu/winslowlab.html) at Stanford University as a Postdoc,
  Chis helped develop a high-throughput technology to study combinatorial tumor suppressor losses in mice and their effects on clonal dynamics.

I am interested in the fields of translational genomics and molecular oncology. 
<!--more--> 
My PhD focused on the molecular signatures of lung cancer. We were the first to discover that the TBX2 subfamily of 
transcription factors are tumor suppressors in lung adenocarcinoma. In human patients, these genes are generally 
deregulated by hypermethylation, which we found promotes oncogenesis and tumor progression in cancer cell lines. 
Intriguingly, each gene activates histone demethylase pathways in a manner that mimics azacitidine therapy. 

In separate projects, I am using multi-omics approaches to understand several familial-inherited diseases, including
congenital heart malformations, hearing loss syndromes, and skin anomalies.

I am currently developing a live mouse model, using the Tuba-seq technology, to further understand the role of the 
TBX2 subfamily in KRAS-driven lung cancers.
