  Slava obtained a PhD from Old Dominion University in Nuclear Physics
  under the guidance of Dr Sebastian Kuhn, 
  studying neutron structure functions. 
  After switching to biology, worked on bioinformatics and data science.

My adventure in science started with studying the structure of the
neutron and eventually led me to computational biology.

After I received my PhD in Nuclear Physics and did a couple of
postdocs, an idea of helping people by taking part in tremendous computational advances
happening in Biology in the last couple of decades seemed too tempting
to ignore. I joined a Systems Biology lab in the University of
Virginia, where I performed statistical and bioinformatics analyses
related to the cardiomyocyte proliferation (or lack of
such). Cardiomyocytes are terminally differentiated cells, which
have problems with proliferating and consequently problems
with properly restoring heart after heart attacks, heart failures,
etc. Turns out, some molecules can make them proliferate and this
can become a life saving treatment if transferred to real life
situations. I also participated in atherosclerosis research trying to
elucidate what and how can protect people from heart attacks and
strokes.

After moving to Cleveland Clinic, I got interested in single cells
RNA-Seq, the technigue that can tell us a lot about what each cell in
a sample is doing, and used this method for data analyses related to
lung, cardiovascular and psychiatric problems.

I joined McFarland Lab in the Summer of 2021 to take part in the
exciting journey of investigating cancer development and consequently
treatment possibilities using Evolutionary Game Theory.
