Bindi's Masters thesis studied the use of plant viral nanoparticles for cancer immunotherapy in [Steinmetz' lab](https://www.steinmetzlab.com/3010867-welcome-cwru) at Case. 
<!--more--> 
Following her master's, she worked at two industry startups where she researched non-invasive glucose monitoring and cancer cell intrinsic immunotherapy.
She is now focused on extending the Tuba-seq technology to model sequential tumorigenic events and intra-tumor heterogeneity via serial transductions.
