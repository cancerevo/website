abstract: Large-scale genomic analyses of human cancers have cataloged somatic point
  mutations thought to initiate tumor development and sustain cancer growth. However,
  determining the functional significance of specific alterations remains a major
  bottleneck in our understanding of the genetic determinants of cancer. Here, we
  present a platform that integrates multiplexed AAV/Cas9-mediated homology-directed
  repair (HDR) with DNA barcoding and high-throughput sequencing to simultaneously
  investigate multiple genomic alterations in de novo cancers in mice. Using this
  approach, we introduce a barcoded library of non-synonymous mutations into hotspot
  codons 12 and 13 of Kras in adult somatic cells to initiate tumors in the lung,
  pancreas, and muscle. High-throughput sequencing of barcoded Kras HDR alleles from
  bulk lung and pancreas reveals surprising diversity in Kras variant oncogenicity.
  Rapid, cost-effective, and quantitative approaches to simultaneously investigate
  the function of precise genomic alterations in vivo will help uncover novel biological
  and clinically actionable insights into carcinogenesis.
