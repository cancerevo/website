abstract: ' Cancer genomes exhibit surprisingly weak signatures of negative selection
  1,2 . This may be because selective pressures are relaxed or because genome-wide
  linkage prevents deleterious mutations from being removed (Hill-Robertson interference)
  3 . By stratifying tumors by their genome-wide mutational burden, we observe negative
  selection (dN/dS $∼$ 0.56) in low mutational burden tumors, while remaining cancers
  exhibit dN/dS ratios $∼$1. This suggests that most tumors do not remove deleterious
  passengers. To buffer against deleterious passengers, tumors upregulate heat shock
  pathways as their mutational burden increases. Finally, evolutionary modeling finds
  that Hill-Robertson interference alone can reproduce patterns of attenuated selection
  and estimates the total fitness cost of passengers to be 46% per cell on average.
  Collectively, our findings suggest that the lack of observed negative selection
  in most tumors is not due to relaxed selective pressures, but rather the inability
  of selection to remove deleterious mutations in the presence of genome-wide linkage. '
