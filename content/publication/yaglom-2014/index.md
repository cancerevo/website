abstract: DNA instability is an important contributor to cancer development. Previously,
  defects in the chromosome segregation and excessive DNA double strand breaks due
  to the replication or oxidative stresses were implicated in DNA instability in cancer.
  Here, we demonstrate that DNA instability can directly result from the oncogene-induced
  senescence signaling. Expression of the activated form of Her2 oncogene, NeuT, in
  immortalized breast epithelial cells led to downregulation of the major DNA repair
  factor histone H2AX and a number of other components of the HR and NHEJ double strand
  DNA breaks repair pathways. H2AX expression was regulated at the transcriptional
  level via a senescence pathway involving p21-mediated regulation of CDK and Rb1.
  The p21-dependent downregulation of H2AX was seen both in cell culture and the MMTV-neu
  mouse model of Her2-positive breast cancer. Importantly, downregulation of H2AX
  upon Her2/NeuT expression impaired repair of double strand DNA breaks. This impairment
  resulted in both increased DNA instability in the form of somatic copy number alterations,
  and in increased sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. Overall,
  these findings indicate that the Her2/NeuT oncogene signaling directly potentiates
  DNA instability and increases sensitivity to DNA damaging treatments.
