abstract: 'Genomic instability and high mutation rates cause cancer to acquire numerous
  mutations and chromosomal alterations during its somatic evolution; most are termed
  passengers because they do not confer cancer phenotypes. Evolutionary simulations
  and cancer genomic studies suggest that mildly deleterious passengers accumulate
  and can collectively slow cancer progression. Clinical data also suggest an association
  between passenger load and response to therapeutics, yet no causal link between
  the effects of passengers and cancer progression has been established. To assess
  this, we introduced increasing passenger loads into human cell lines and immunocompromised
  mouse models. We found that passengers dramatically reduced proliferative fitness
  (∼3% per Mb), slowed tumor growth, and reduced metastatic progression. We developed
  new genomic measures of damaging passenger load that can accurately predict the
  fitness costs of passengers in cell lines and in human breast cancers. We conclude
  that genomic instability and an elevated load of DNA alterations in cancer is a
  double-edged sword: it accelerates the accumulation of adaptive drivers, but incurs
  a harmful passenger load that can outweigh driver benefit. The effects of passenger
  alterations on cancer fitness were unrelated to enhanced immunity, as our tests
  were performed either in cell culture or in immunocompromised animals. Our findings
  refute traditional paradigms of passengers as neutral events, suggesting that passenger
  load reduces the fitness of cancer cells and slows or prevents progression of both
  primary and metastatic disease. The antitumor effects of chemotherapies can in part
  be due to the induction of genomic instability and increased passenger load. Cancer
