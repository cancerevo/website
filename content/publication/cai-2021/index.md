abstract: Cancer genotyping has identified a large number of putative tumor suppressor
  genes. Carcinogenesis is a multi-step process, however the importance and specific
  roles of many of these genes during tumor initiation, growth and progression remain
  unknown. Here we use a multiplexed mouse model of oncogenic KRAS-driven lung cancer
  to quantify the impact of forty-eight known and putative tumor suppressor genes
  on diverse aspects of carcinogenesis at an unprecedented scale and resolution. We
  uncover many previously understudied functional tumor suppressors that constrain
  cancer in vivo. Inactivation of some genes substantially increased growth, while
  the inactivation of others increases tumor initiation and/or the emergence of exceptionally
  large tumors. These functional in vivo analyses revealed an unexpectedly complex
  landscape of tumor suppression that has implications for understanding cancer evolution,
  interpreting clinical cancer genome sequencing data, and directing approaches to
  limit tumor initiation and progression.
