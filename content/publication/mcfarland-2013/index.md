abstract: Cancer progression is driven by the accumulation of a small number of genetic
  alterations. However, these few driver alterations reside in a cancer genome alongside
  tens of thousands of additional mutations termed passengers. Passengers are widely
  believed to have no role in cancer, yet many passengers fall within protein-coding
  genes and other functional elements that can have potentially deleterious effects
  on cancer cells. Here we investigate the potential of moderately deleterious passengers
  to accumulate and alter the course of neoplastic progression. Our approach combines
  evolutionary simulations of cancer progression with an analysis of cancer sequencing
  data. From simulations, we find that passengers accumulate and largely evade natural
  selection during progression. Although individually weak, the collective burden
  of passengers alters the course of progression, leading to several oncological phenomena
  that are hard to explain with a traditional driver-centric view. We then tested
  the predictions of our model using cancer genomics data and confirmed that many
  passengers are likely damaging and have largely evaded negative selection. Finally,
  we use our model to explore cancer treatments that exploit the load of passengers
  by either (i) increasing the mutation rate or (ii) exacerbating their deleterious
  effects. Though both approaches lead to cancer regression, the latter is a more
  effective therapy. Our results suggest a unique framework for understanding cancer
  progression as a balance of driver and passenger mutations.
