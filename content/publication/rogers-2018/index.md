abstract: The functional impact of most genomic alterations found in cancer, alone
  or in combination, remains largely unknown. Here we integrate tumor barcoding, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated
  genome editing and ultra-deep barcode sequencing to interrogate pairwise combinations
  of tumor suppressor alterations in autochthonous mouse models of human lung adenocarcinoma.
  We map the tumor suppressive effects of 31 common lung adenocarcinoma genotypes
  and identify a landscape of context dependence and differential effect strengths.
