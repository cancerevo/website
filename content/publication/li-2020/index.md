abstract: The lack of knowledge about the relationship between tumor genotypes and
  therapeutic responses remains one of the most important gaps in enabling the effective
  use of cancer therapies. Here, we couple a multiplexed and quantitative platform
  with robust statistical methods to enable pharmacogenomic mapping of lung cancer
  treatment responses in vivo . We uncover a surprisingly complex map of genotype-specific
  therapeutic responses, with over 20% of possible interactions showing significant
  resistance or sensitivity. We validate one of these interactions - the resistance
  of Keap1 mutant tumors to platinum therapy - using a large patient response dataset.
  Our results highlight the importance of understanding the genetic determinants of
  treatment responses in the development of precision therapies and define a strategy
  to identify such determinants.
