abstract: Cancer progression is an example of a rapid adaptive process where evolving
  new traits is essential for survival and requires a high mutation rate. Precancerous
  cells acquire a few key mutations that drive rapid population growth and carcinogenesis.
  Cancer genomics demonstrates that these few driver mutations occur alongside thousands
  of random passenger mutations-a natural consequence of cancer's elevated mutation
  rate. Some passengers are deleterious to cancer cells, yet have been largely ignored
  in cancer research. In population genetics, however, the accumulation of mildly
  deleterious mutations has been shown to cause population meltdown. Here we develop
  a stochastic population model where beneficial drivers engage in a tug-of-war with
  frequent mildly deleterious passengers. These passengers present a barrier to cancer
  progression describable by a critical population size, below which most lesions
  fail to progress, and a critical mutation rate, above which cancers melt down. We
  find support for this model in cancer age-incidence and cancer genomics data that
  also allow us to estimate the fitness advantage of drivers and fitness costs of
  passengers. We identify two regimes of adaptive evolutionary dynamics and use these
  regimes to understand successes and failures of different treatment strategies.
  A tumor's load of deleterious passengers can explain previously paradoxical treatment
  outcomes and suggest that it could potentially serve as a biomarker of response
  to mutagenic therapies. The collective deleterious effect of passengers is currently
  an unexploited therapeutic target. We discuss how their effects might be exacerbated
  by current and future therapies.
