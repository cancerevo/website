# Our Values


# Chris' Mentoring Statement



# Indigenous Land Acknowledgment 

In recognizing the land upon which we reside, we express our gratitude and appreciation to those who lived and worked here before us,
those whose stewardship and resilient spirit makes our residence possible on this traditional homeland of
the Lenape (Delaware), Shawnee, Wyandot Miami, Ottawa, Potawatomi, and other Great Lakes tribes. 

What does this do?
