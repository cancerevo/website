# Mission
The development of cancer is a somatic evolutionary process. 
Evolving diseases are difficult to treat because they adapt to treatment and because they continually diversify --- _from so simple a beginning, endless forms evolved_.
We integrate evolutionary theory with quantitative experimentation to better understand cancers.
