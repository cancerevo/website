Technological advances in genomics and computation are revolutionizing our understanding of cancer. 
We believe these advances will make sense only in the light of evolution.
Specifically, we believe evolutionary theory can answer many of the most enigmatic aspects of tumor biology, including: 

* Why do most tumors never progress to malignancy? 

* Why are mutations that drive growth in one tumor maladaptive in another? 

* Why do the other ‘passenger’ mutations appear to be unaffected by natural selection?

To answer these questions, our lab pursues an interdisciplinary and inter-laboratory approach that combines experiment and theory with tech development.
