  <summary><b>Graduate Students</b></summary>
  "Integrative Biology" isn't the newest department at Case — it's been our governing philosophy since designing the 
  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5617793/#:~:text=In%201956%2C%20Western%20Reserve%20University,was%20introduced%20in%20the%201950s.">
  first joint MD-PhD program in 1956</a> (apply <a href="https://case.edu/medicine/admissions-programs/md-phd-program">here</a>). 
  Our PhD only program is equally integrative:  
    students submit a single application, choose from over 30 programs in the life and medical sciences, rotate within <strong>any</strong> lab accepting students, 
  and then join whichever program best suits their integrative educational goals (apply <a href="https://case.edu/medicine/bstp/">here</a>). You are not the property of a department at Case.
</p> 
  Please mention Prof. McFarland in your cover letter, so that I can be sure to review your application. 
  You are also encouraged to` <a href="#contact">contact me</a> directly (before or after applying) to discuss fit.
