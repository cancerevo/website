Scientists of all academic levels are encouraged to apply. All students and researchers must be team players, demonstrate scientific curiosity and self-motivation, and articulate a scientific vision that aligns with the lab’s goals. Both life & physical scientists; MD & PhD students; and wet- and dry-lab specialists are encouraged to apply. 

Everyone in the Cancer Evolution group is committed to fostering a better living and learning environment. We value equity and inclusion, and celebrate diversity in all forms.

  <summary><b>Graduate Students</b></summary>
  We are recruiting graduate students through the

  and <a href="https://case.edu/medicine/pathology/training/phd-program/cancer-biology-training-program">Cancer Biology Training Program (CBTP)</a> at Case.
  Please note that there are over 30 programs in BTSP ranging from biophysics (my upbringing) to pathology, and that Case is a world leader in integrating
