# Theoretical Assumptions

Our lab studies enigmatic aspects of tumor evolution. 
For example, why do most tumors never progress to malignancy? 
Why are the mutations that drive carcinogenesis sometimes maladaptive to tumor growth? And how do all the other ‘passenger’ mutations affect tumor 
evolution?
